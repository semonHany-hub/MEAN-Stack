- js is loosely(dynamic) typed language where its variables types determined in run time.

                    classes in ES6, typescript

                              AJAX
-different applications[ios->swift, android->java-kotlin, web->js, desktop->js-java-c#] each of them has a different built-in function to deal with the request API.
-AJAX (async js and xml)

                            review_basics
- event-loop(js lifecycle):short-time tasks go to task-queue while async function or need-to-wait funcs go to web-services corner until it become ready then go to task-queue,
 while functions in task-queue wait the execution(call)stack to be empty.
-callBack function is a function body called inside another function.
-hoisting, redeclaration, reassignment feasibility and scope_blocking with var, let, const declared variables: [*hoisting->var, *redeclaration->var, *reassignment->var, let, *function_block->var, let, const, *scope_block(condition, loop)->let, const];
-the property opacity:0.3 make the whole element with its child elements transparent then when we show the meal details above the main page we give its container background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.3).
-charset:"utf-8" is a symboling languages.


                             Node.js
-'npm install nodemon' then we can run command 'npx nodemon file_name.js' or simply 'nodemon' to enable listening to any change and auto-updating, use rs to restart manual whenever you want.
-'node file_name.js' this command run node server                        
-node.js server read strings by default,
 but if we want to change it we use the method setHeader in response and pass to it two parameters:
 the first represent the property and the second is its value.
-postman app used to test for request methods for back-end developer
-if we want to read arrays or objects we set Content-Type to the value application/json and always use the method JSON.stringify() in res.end()


                            express
-'http cats' website show you http status cases in funny way
-LTS(latest supported) version of an app means many editions have been done on it , while current version mean that it's the most modern but there's a probability for bugs
-'npm init -y' used to initialise your express project, with the flag'-y' it will check the truth of your commands,
 then we install express library locally in the project folder using 'npm i express'.
-'npm i live-server -D' install live-server with the flag "-D" stand for "--save-development" will be saved in devDependencies object
-we add property "start" in the object script in package.json file in Day11 folder to enable using command 'npm start' while running the server,
 but when we add a vague name as "semon" we use command 'npm run semon'.
-the command 'require("")' used n ES5 ,instead we use import command in ES6.
-synchronous exec means execute line by line on single thread, although js is async with single thread as it use 'lib UV' which belongs to node.js and provides threads pool.
-'jwt(json web token)' website used to decoding and encoding, while 'Bcrypt hash' used for encoding
-hashing in bcrypt library consist of [4-19] rounds , each round is of 4 stages.
-bcrypt library is one-way-encryption ,then it doesn't has a method for decipher.
-mongoose provide ODM(object document model) library to enable connecting mongoDB to express
-when we use static arrays with CRUD operations all changes will gone after restarting server, 
 so we use arrays defined in external json file using fs module in node.js or mongoDB using mongoose in express.js
-install the extension 'node express'.
-we add authentication on email and password, then authorization using jwt token in each protected request.
-'ctrl+c' close the server


                            angular
-frameworks use SPA (single page application) concept which means routing between pages without refreshing.
-angular is jsframework depending on typescript. running on CLI(command line interface).
-CSR(client side rendering) means running on PC browser, while SSR(server side rendering) interacting with server(req-res).
-'npm install -g @angular/cli@18' angular installation with version 18(can be changed as you want).
-'ng version' show the version of angular, node, package manager.
-'ng new app-name' create project structure
-gitignore file control ignoring big-size folders while uploading to gothub.
-public folder used to include files to access globally on the project (eg.images).
-'ng serve -o' with the flag '-o' for '--open' will open the bage once creating server-URL.
-spec files used for testing.
-'ng generate component com-name' or 'ng g c c-name' for creating component with its template, style, spec and ts files.
-binding (sharing data between template and ts files in the same component) has two types:
 -> one-way-binding:text interpolation'{{:string}}'- event binding:'(:event)=function()(.ts)' - property binding:'[html-property]=ts-variable' 
 -> two-way-binding:[(ngModel)]=variable(.ts).
-in angularV17 we use decorators if-switch conditions and for loops, while previously we used ng directives in commonModule.
-service is a class wich can e imported in components, injected in constructor parameters or use new keyword(let service=new productsService()).
-we use services to share data and methods between components that has't direct relation enable using @Input, @Output.
-we use in component class the methods: ngOnInit(){} ->called on loading the comp-page, 
 ngOnChanges() ->called each time this class recieve data from parent(@Input()),
 ngOnDestroy() ->called while leaving the comp-page. after implementing them.
-implements keyword used for inheritence in typescript.
-<ng-content></> in child comp used to receive template that might be written in its selector in parent comp.
